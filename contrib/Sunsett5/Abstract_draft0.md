**A Heterogeneous-agents Model of Economic Growth with Risk Averse Behavior**

The study presents an extension to existing heterogenous-agents models of economic growth. Endogenous growth due to technological innovation has been studied extensively, although many hinge on representative market. In this model, we attribute the R&D capacity of a country to government spending on public facilities. We show that heterogenous risk-averse behavior of household investors affect the long-run impact of government expenditure through heterogeneous asset holding preference. The calibrated model is then tested against panel of ... countries.
