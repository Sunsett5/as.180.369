    "## Abstract\n",
    "The study extends the scope of evolutionary economics to the study of competition and convergence. While the concept of endogenous growth driven by the R&D sector has been extensively studied, the majority of pioneering works, such as {cite:t}`Romer_1990`, have been grounded in the assumption of homogeneous research products. Building on the recent contribution by {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017` in the field of evolutionary economics, this paper introduces the overlooked heterogeneity in R&D innovation and imitation routines. Models' parameters will be adjusted to study the underlying uncertainty of innovative R&D and the environment in which innovation thrives in an international market setting. Through Monte Carlo simulations, this research explores the implications of heterogeneity within these various agents on innovation and the dynamic competition among international firms resulting in convergence or divergence. By addressing this important research gap, we aim to shed light on the nuanced dynamics that govern economic growth and identify possible sources to divergence observed in cross-country empirical studies."

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "{cite:t}`Romer_1990`'s endogenous growth model introduces new ways of looking at long-term growth in total factor productivity through technological advancement. In his model, a seperate sector of research and development (R&D) utilizes labor and capital resources to produce knowledge, a partially excludable good.  Upon creation of new tecnology, other agents can utilize this spillover knowledge to advance their own research to the extent of not infringing on intellectual property rights. This advantage enables developing countries to catch up with their technologically advanced counterparts by \"imitating\" their advanced technologies. The process of catching-up or \"Convergence,\" has, however, not found strong empirical support. In {cite:t}`Johnson_Papageorgiou_2020`'s comprehensive survey of convergence literature spanning the last five decades, the income gap between poorer and richer countries has shown more persistence than conventional theory would suggest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several studies have sought to identify the critical institutional factors that might influence convergence. For instance, {cite:t}`Barro_Sala-i-Martin_2014` examined a panel of 88 countries, investigating 67 explanatory variables frequently utilized in empirical growth literature. These variables encompass factors like life expectancy, fertility rates, rule of law indices, education, investment ratios, government expenditure ratios, openness, terms-of-trade, inflation, democracy, and more.  To bridge the gap between theoretical models and these empirical observations, {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017` employs a multi-country, multi-industry agent-based model based on evolutionary models by {cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_2004`. Dosi et al's model incorporates heterogeneous firms from different countries and industries, engaging in competitive international trade. In contrast to {cite:t}`Romer_1990`, the multi-sectoral framework facilitates the observation of path-dependent structural changes. Additionally, the open economy feature illustrates how countries exploit technology gaps, shedding light on the process by which convergence, divergence, or polarization into low- and high-growth economies takes place. \n",
    "\n",
    "{cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017` make valuable contributions to endogenous growth theories, introducing heterogeneity among firms and market power. Yet, one aspect that has remained relatively unexplored is the concious choice between two main R&D operations: innovating and imitating as defined in the Bass diffusion model {cite:t}`Bass_1969`. This research aims to address this gap by employing an heterogenous-agents evolutionary model based on {cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_2004`, augmented by {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`'s dynamic of market share and international competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`'s focus on naturally emerging divergence, my model will introduce heterogeneity in both productivity and initial R&D routines (choices between innovation and imitation). Over time, the Schumpeterian dynamic competition will allow only the most profitable firms to suvive natural selection ({cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982`). Utilizing this aspect of evolutionary economics, I can analyzes two aspects of economic growth that are not feasible in representative-agent neoclassical models. First, firms' routines or decision making are determined endogenously which allow them to search for more optimal strategies as the settings evolve over time. Second, the evolutionary process take into account the dynamic adjustment process leading to equilibrium. This paper will further show that the degree of convergence at equilibrium are both path dependent and are directly influenced by international competition between firms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since imperfect competition gives rise to heterogenous market power and profitability, this paper aims to demonstrate how market concentration, as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), influences convergence. By introducing this new dimension of factors that afftect innovation tendency, I aim to illuminate the nuanced dynamics underlying economic growth and identify potential sources for the observed divergence in cross-country empirical studies. Finally, the results will serve as a theoretical evidence to the importance of heterogeneity in an endogenous growth models and its impacts on innovation, competition, long-term productivity growth, and convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this work is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces seminal works in the field of economic growth and the motivation behind revolutionary models that this paper is based on. In Section 3, the model is presented. Simulation results are analyzed in Section 4, and Section 5 concludes the theoretical findings. "

    "Creating knowledge requires diverting human and capital stocks away from consumer goods and capital production. The economy in turn trades current consumption for future productivity growth. Knowledge, however, possesses a unique attribute separating it from consumer and capital goods â€“ it is only partially excludable due to intellectual property laws.\n",
    "\n",
    "This situation results in positive externalities that contribute to economic growth. Nonetheless, profit-maximizing agents, driven solely by private benefits, often disregard these broader social advantages. This leads to two noteworthy consequences: First, investments in capital are below optimal level, and the employment of researchers remains Pareto inefficient ({cite:t}`Fine_2000`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, developing countries can capitalize on the existing knowledge created by more technologically-advanced nations without the need to invest significantly in their research and development.\n",
    "\n",
    ". In theory, advanced economies operating at the technological frontier should experience a slowdown in growth, ultimately closing the gap between countries with varying levels of technological advancement. \n",
    "\n",
    "In response to this challenge, the term of \"conditional convergence\" emerged, asserting that two countries will reach the same steady state of economic growth only if their internal factors supporting economic growth are aligned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firms must assess whether a specific R&D innovation is going to be successful, reflecting the underlying uncertainty of operating at the frontier of technology. In contrast, firms could invest in R&D imitation project instead, which relies on the positive externality nature of knowledge. As the profitability of a certain R&D project depends greatly on the actions other firms are taking, the models can be best modeled with heterogenous agents making decisions based on their distinct stock of capital, market share, current productivity, etc. compared to other firms in international markets. The choices made by these agents are also influenced by macroeconomic variables, such as policy interest rates, world interest rates, inflation,political stability, and market volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, {cite:t}`Romer_1990` stated that such distinction is inconsequential to the result observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "{cite:t}`Arawatari_Hori_Mino_2023`'s model consists of one closed economy and is calibrated to observe the impact of government expenditures on economic growth based on U.S. data."

    "## 2. Literature Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the same level of labor and capital, modern economies can produce much more efficiently than their historical counterparts due to an increase in total factor productivity (TFP). Economists in the 1950s attributed most of this growth to technological advancement ({cite:t}`Schultz_Abramovitz_1957`; {cite:t}`Kendrick_1956`; {cite:t}`Solow_1956`). Despite acknowledging technology as primary driver of long-run growth, early economic models continued to treat it as an exogenous factor, requiring empirical observation. In contrast to these earlier approaches, more recent models, notably {cite:t}`Romer_1990`'s endogenous technological change model, have internalized technology as a consequence of profit-maximizing economic agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the topic of endogenous growth, the influence of {cite:t}`Romer_1990` cannot be overstated. His paper formalized the partial excludability of knowledge. Both simple observation and economic principles support this quality of knowledge as a good. Practical examples include patents, copyright, trade secrets, industrial design rights, database rights, etc. which are protected by intellectual property laws. This protection excludes other firms from directly utilizing the research product but not prevents them to learn from the knowledge that might be made public and create new innovations of their own. On the economic side, {cite:t}`Romer_1990` explains that without some degree of excludablity, firms will not be incentived to engage in research in the first place. Consequently, models with perfectly competitive markets would not function properly with knowledge production because they cannot afford to incur cost higher than the market marginal cost of production. Had one firm engaged in research, they would lose profitability in the short run and gain no competitive edge in the long run without excludability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concern of suboptimal level of R&D still holds even in partial excludability case. {cite:t}`Arrow_1962` and {cite:t}`Romer_1986` demonstrates that decentralized choices can lead to suboptimal level of research because private agents do not account for spillovers of knowledge. This problem leads to a new branch of models such as in {cite:t}`Barro_1990` which focuses on whether government spending can help fix market failure. In order to test model robustness, empirical research on conditional convergence are conducted ({cite:t}`Barro_2015`). Apart from the identifying factors affecting convergence, he also found that significance of each variable is subject to the chosen functional forms and the set of variables under consideration. Particularly, the inclusion of country fixed effects could alter significance level of multiple factors, implying that a large portion of technological gap is still unexplained. Thus, it might be advantageous to look at the mechanisms behind economic growth through a theoretical framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper presents an evolutionary model for the roles of R&D and international competition. The two factors are connected through the partial-excluablity property of knowledge. It is the possiblity of gaining temporary market power over other firms that drive innovation in the first place, and competition ensures that firms will need to keep innovating. Nonetheless, the situation of pervasive innovation and competition might not hold true as {cite:t}`Schumpeter_1950` argued that the rate of innovation is accelerated primary with large firms with market power. Thus, it is possible for the equilibrium to consist of few innovators who dominate the market. This will be one of the situations that my model aims to capture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent theoretical research began to put more focus on heterogeneity of economic agents. {cite:t}`Arawatari_Hori_Mino_2023` proposed a heterogeneous-agents model that takes into account labor market heterogeneity. In his model, household agents exhibit varying levels of entrepreneurial ability, affecting their inclination to engage in innovation and their compensation. Although the emphasis on heterogeneity and microfoundation of economic models were quite recent, seminal works such as {cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982` had long paved the way for simulation-based analysis consisting of heterogenous agents. Firms in his model follow {cite:t}`Bass_1969`'s diffusion model and are given individual routines whether to innovate new technology or imitate other firms in the industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "{cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017` presents an extension to the model by including the role of the international market in technology accumulation through a heterogenous-agent model with imperfect competition. Instead of modelling research as a separate sector as in {cite:t}`Romer_1990`, he assumed that research occurs inside each consumption-good firm. The specification implies that partial excludability must exist in the form of market power for consumption goods. {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`'s model also explicit identify the difference between innovation and imitation as two separate R&D choices; however, the ratio of of R&D spent on each category is assumed to be fixed and homogenous among all agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simplification is significant because  firms' preferences on innovation and imitation could depend on its size as proposed by {cite:t}`Schumpeter_1950`. Since innovation involves high uncertainty, some might be drawn to the untapped potential, while others may choose to adopt existing technology from other firms instead. Additionally, as the landscape evolves, firms may have different optimal routines and will have to adjust accordingly. Thus, this paper will provide an extension to {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017` in the form of heterogenous R&D preferences. The innovation and imitation mechanism follows both {cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982`, while the market share dynamics is simplified from {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`."

    "## 3. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The model presented here is based primarily on the evolutionary model of economic growth by {cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982` and innovation-imitation process of the Bass diffusion model {cite:t}`Bass_1969`. The original model of {cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982` is a variation of enodogenous growth models that aims to determine optimal decision through natural selection rather than analytically solving for profit-maximizing behavior at equilibrium as in orthodox approaches. I adapted the model to include multiple economies with heterogenous starting levels of total factor productivity in order to study the effect of R&D on convergence. The model consists of $N$ economies (indexed by $i$) with $S$ firms per country. The goods produced in this model are assumed to be the same kind; however, each firm possesses market power corresponding to their market share. Thus, the market is imperfectly competitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technological growth can occur either due to innovation of new technology or imitation from other firms in the same industry. The innovation process becomes dominant when firms have high market power and are able to exclusively profits from their private knowledge. This benefit is offset by the imitation process which reflects the partial-excludability of knowledge stock discussed in {cite:t}`Romer_1990` and allows for the possibility of economic convergence. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Timeline of the events\n",
    "1. At the start of time step $t$, each firm $j$ generates revenue from its existing technology. The gross profit is spent on R&D operation either through innovation or imitation, while the rest is recorded as net income.\n",
    "2. If the R&D operation is successful, the firm labor productivity will increase at time step $t+1$.\n",
    "3. Firms' market share evolves as they discover new technology and can achieve more (or less) competitive pricing.\n",
    "4. After a period of time, entry and exit of firms are determined by their net profit margin, which is calculated from net income and revunue. Therefore, firms with high market power or high total factor productivity are most likely to stay in the industry.\n",
    "5. Step 1-3 are repeated until dynamic equilibrium is achieved. At this point, surviving firms are those with optimal investment routines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections will discuss the model framework in details. The value of the constants used in this model are available in the appendix.\n"

    "A common feature of economic growth model is an assumption of constant or increasing returns to factors of production. In {cite:t}`Lucas_1988` and {cite:t}`Rebelo_1991`, the constant returns to scale applies to both rival $($labor $L$ and capital $K)$ and nonrival $($technology $A)$ factors. However, I choose not to excplicitly model the factors of production here because this paper focuses on innovation and imitation of which characterstics can be studied independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the efficiency production depends only on the total factor productivity $(A)$, while sales depend on th market share $(f)$ and mark-up $(m)$ on the cost of production. The revenue $(R)$ and gross profit $(G)$ are calculated as:\n",

    "R &= (1+m)fA \\\\\n",
    "G &= mfA\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to the \"learning by doing\" model of {cite:t}`Arrow_1962`, knowledge is not automatically generated through production in this model. I follow {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`'s approach of allocating a part of revenues to R&D spending with one important adjustment. In {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`, every firm in the model are assumed to spend fixed and equal proportion of their revenues on innovation and imitation. This approach has two limitations: 1. It ignores the heterogeneity of firms. Some firms might aim to innovate and constantly push the frontier in order to gain temporary benefits from the partially-excludable knowledge. Other firms might instead employ a \"fast second\" strategy and focus on replicating existing technology ({cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982`). 2. In different market conditions, firms' optimal investment behaviors are likely to differ. Through variation and subsequent natural selection, the optimal solutions at the dynamic equilibrium can de determined.\n",

    "One approach of modeling firms' behavior is analytical at micro level. Since the formulation of expectation in hetereogenous agents model can be complicated to model, require numerous assumptions especially during transition toward equilibrium ({cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982`), this paper does not attempt to perform such analytic investigation. Instead, Monte Carlo similution is employed to measure the effectiveness of each R&D choice through natural selection process which will \"drive from an inÂ­ dustry all but the efficient profit maximizers\" ({cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982`). \n",

Both are drawn unifromly and independently from $U(0,1)$ at the start of simulation.  In the spirit of {cite:t}`Friedman_1953`, \"Let the apparent immediate determinant of business behavior be anyÂ­ thing at all-habitual reaction, random chance or what not. WhenÂ­ ever this determinant happens to lead to behavior consistent with rational and informed maximization of returns, the business will prosper and acquire resources with which to expand; whenever it does not the business will tend to lose resources and can be kept in existence only by the addition of resources from outside.\" This uninformative prior of firms' distribution ensures that most of the possible decisions are first considered.

    "In line with {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`, the innovation and imitation processes are modeled as two-step stochastic process. Firstly, the success of innovation or imitation is drawn from $Bern(\\theta)$. The probabilities of success ($\\theta _\\text{IN}, \\theta _\\text{IM}$) are positively related to R&D expenditure. In order to study the environment in which innovation is relatively more successful than imitation and vice versa, the firms' search capabilities ($\\xi_{1,2} > 0$) are adjustable.\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The equations above are modified from {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`, in that the success rate of R&D no longer depends on the spending $IN$, $IM$ directly. In such model, R&D search procedure will be exponentially more successful as the economy grows larger (higher $A$), thereby reducing the impact of varying investment decisions since $\\theta$ will be approaching 1 regardless of the decisions. Here, $\\theta$ depends on R&D ratio $\\rho$, innovation ratio $\\lambda$, and the market share $(f)$ since larger firms benefit from economies of scale in knowledge production and possess superior managment, financing, risk-spreading ({cite:t}`Schumpeter_1950`).\n",

    "A firm with successful imitation will randomly copy another firm productivity. As in {cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982`, the probability to imitate a particular is proportional to the market share $f$ of the firms. Firms are assumed to look for \"widely used techniques\" as opposed to \"best practice\" and thus are more likely to learn the technology from dominant firms in the market {cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982`. This is in line with the models of diffusion in which firms can only discern the effectiveness of each technique through its apparent success. Consequently, a successful innovation will only be noticeable to other firms when it is able to reduce cost and occupy higher market share over a period of time. The advantageous outcome of this assumption is that innovative firms have longer time to monopolistically benefit from its own innovation. The imitation processes occur both domestically and internationally, although international imitation incurs a multiplicative penalty $\\epsilon > 1$ to the probability of being imitated. The challenge of imitating foreign techniques are further discussed in {cite:t}`Abramovitz_1986` and {cite:t}`Fagerberg_Godinho_2006`.\n",

The profitability of the company is determined from the total discounted Net Profit Margin ($NPM$). Because R&D spending means sacrificing current income for increased future productivity and income, the discounting factor can represent either 1) the opportunity cost of not investing the income elsewhere or 2) the required returns from shareholders or creditors who finance the operation.\n",

The parameters of beta distribution are set with minimal deviations from the original set of R&D behaviors. The random noises can also be considered a local seach of an optimal behavior; thus, it makes sense for the step to be reasonably small."

    "To examine the dynamics of technological innovation, competition, and the extent of convergence, every firm is assigned varying level of productivity but with equal initial market share and mark-up ratio. The R&D ratios $(\\rho, \\lambda)$ are uniformly sampled from the interval $(0,1)$ at the start of the simulation.

    "### Search Capabilities (Effectiveness of Innovation and Imitation)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the central question of this paper is to find environmental factors that affect R&D decisions of firms. The first factor that can be manipulated exogenously is the effectiveness of innovation and imitatin. Each firm is given identical search capabilities which determine the likelihood of successful innovation and imitation. {ref}`f_survive_10_20_40_11_100_100_50-fig`, {ref}`f_survive_10_20_40_11_100_20_50-fig`, {ref}`f_survive_10_20_40_11_20_100_50-fig`, {ref}`f_survive_10_20_40_11_20_20_50-fig` show the posterior distribution of firms' R&D decisions for 4 scenarios with varying degree of effectiveness of R&D operations from single simulation. The left figures represent the dynamic equilibrium where each firm is making optimal decisions given the characteristics $(A,\\rho,\\lambda,f,m)$ of each firm in the market. The right figures show the evolution of national average productivity (colors are used to designate countries of origin, while size represents the market share of individual firms).\n",

    "The right figure shows that the average productivity of a few countries accelerates far beyond other countries, revealing a strong sign of divergence. The left figure shows that the advanced economies are actually dominated by a few highly successful firms. An interesting observation is that such firms do not necessarily need to be dedicated R&D spenders (as indicated by low $\\rho$). This can be explained by their high market shares which allow them to not only gain more net income but also have more budget. Despite only a small fraction spent on R&D, their overwhelming base budget means the investment becomes larger and more effective. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the divergence can be attributed to two separate but connected mechanisms. First, imitation is ineffective in this scenario, so it is unlikely for firms to catch up with early leaders. With this early advantage in productivity, the early leaders snowball into internationally dominant firms. At this point, the market power effect kicks in, and regardless of the R&D decisions, other firms will continue to be less and less likely to catch up due to limited market space.\n",
