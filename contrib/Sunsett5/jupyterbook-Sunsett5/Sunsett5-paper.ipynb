    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "The study extends the scope of endogenous growth model with heterogeneous-agents models. While the concept of endogenous growth driven by the R&D sector has been extensively studied, the majority of pioneering works, such as {cite:t}`Romer_1990`, have been grounded in the assumption of homogeneous research products. Building on recent contributions by {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`, which introduced heterogeneity into the production and R&D process, this paper introduce overlooked heterogeneity in the size of R&D expense and distinct preferences for engaging in innovative research as opposed to imitating other firms in the same industry. Models' parameters will be adjusted to study the underlying uncertainty of innovative R&D and the environment in which innovation thrives in an international market setting. Through Monte Carlo simulations, this research explores the implications of heterogeneity within these various agents on innovation, long-term productivity growth, and convergence. By addressing this important research gap, we aim to shed light on the nuanced dynamics that govern economic growth and identify possible sources to divergence observed in cross-country empirical studies."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "{cite:t}`Romer_1990`'s endogenous growth model introduces new ways of looking at growth in total factor productivity through technology. In his model, research and development (R&D) as an alternative sector which utilizes labor and capital resources to produce knowledge, a partially excludable good. Creating knowledge requires diverting human and capital stocks away from consumer goods and capital production. The economy in turn trades current consumption for future productivity growth. Knowledge, however, possesses a unique attribute separating it from consumer and capital goods â€“ it is only partially excludable due to intellectual property laws. Other agents can freely utilize this spillover knowledge to advance their own research, not infringing on intellectual property rights. This situation results in positive externalities that contribute to economic growth. Nonetheless, profit-maximizing agents, driven solely by private benefits, often disregard these broader social advantages. This leads to two noteworthy consequences: First, investments in capital are below optimal level, and the employment of researchers remains Pareto inefficient ({cite:t}`Fine_2000`). Second, developing countries can capitalize on the existing knowledge created by more technologically-advanced nations without the need to invest significantly in their research and development.\n",
    "\n",
    "This advantage enables developing countries to catch up with their technologically advanced counterparts. In theory, advanced economies operating at the technological frontier should experience a slowdown in growth, ultimately closing the gap between countries with varying levels of technological advancement. This concept, often referred to as \"convergence\" in economic growth, has, however, not found strong empirical support. In {cite:t}`Johnson_Papageorgiou_2020`'s comprehensive survey of convergence literature spanning the last five decades, the income gap between poorer and richer countries has shown more persistence than conventional theory would suggest.\n",
    "\n",
    "In response to this challenge, the term of \"conditional convergence\" emerged, asserting that two countries will reach the same steady state of economic growth only if their internal factors supporting economic growth are aligned. Several studies have sought to identify these critical internal factors. For instance, {cite:t}`Barro_Sala-i-Martin_2014` examined a panel of 88 countries, investigating 67 explanatory variables frequently utilized in empirical growth literature. These variables encompass factors like life expectancy, fertility rates, rule of law indices, education, investment ratios, government expenditure ratios, openness, terms-of-trade, inflation, democracy, and more. The significance of each variable is subject to the chosen functional forms and the set of variables under consideration {cite:t}`Barro_2015`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To bridge the gap between endogenous growth models and these empirical observations, {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017` introduced a multi-country, multi-industry agent-based model. This model incorporates heterogeneous firms from different countries and industries, engaging in competitive international trade. In contrast to {cite:t}`Romer_1990`, the multi-sectoral framework facilitates the observation of structural changes. Additionally, the open economy feature illustrates how countries exploit technology gaps, shedding light on whether convergence, divergence, or polarization into low- and high-growth economies occurs. \n",
    "\n",
    "{cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017` make valuable contributions to endogenous growth theories, introducing heterogeneity among firms and the skills of workers. Yet, one aspect that has remained relatively unexplored is the concious choice between innovation and imitation R&D. Firms must assess whether a specific R&D innovation is going to be successful, reflecting the underlying uncertainty of operating at the frontier of technology. In contrast, firms could invest in R&D imitation project instead, which relies on the positive externality nature of knowledge. As the profitability of a certain R&D project depends greatly on the actions other firms are taking, the models can be best modeled with heterogenous agents making decisions based on their distinct stock of capital, market share, current productivity, etc. compared to other firms in international markets. The choices made by these agents are also influenced by macroeconomic variables, such as policy interest rates, world interest rates, inflation, political stability, and market volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "This research employs Monte Carlo simulations to explore the implications of heterogeneity within these diverse agents on innovation, long-term productivity growth, and convergence. By introducing this new dimension of factors that afftect innovation tendency, we aim to illuminate the nuanced dynamics underlying economic growth and identify potential sources for the observed divergence in cross-country empirical studies."

    "## Literature Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the same level of labor and capital, modern economies can produce much more efficiently than their historical counterparts due to an increase in total factor productivity (TFP). Economists in the 1950s attributed most of this growth to technological advancement ({cite:t}`Schultz_Abramovitz_1957`; {cite:t}`Kendrick_1956`; {cite:t}`Solow_1956`). Despite acknowledging technology as primary driver of long-run growth, early economic models continued to treat it as an exogenous factor, requiring empirical observation. However, in contrast to these earlier approaches, more recent models, notably {cite:t}`Romer_1990`'s endogenous technological change model, have internalized technology as a consequence of profit-maximizing economic agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the topic of endogenous growth, the influence of {cite:t}`Romer_1990` cannot be overstated. His paper formalized the partial excludability of knowledge. Both simple observation and economic principles support this quality of knowledge as a good. Practical examples include patents, copyright, trade secrets, industrial design rights, database rights, etc. which are protected by intellectual property laws. This protection excludes other firms from directly utilizing the research product but not prevents them to learn from the knowledge that might be made public and create new innovations of their own. On the economic side, {cite:t}`Romer_1990` explains that without some degree of excludablity, firms will not be incentived to engage in research in the first place. This is particularly critical in perfectly competitive market with identical firms because they cannot afford to incur cost higher than the market marginal cost of production. Had one firm engaged in research, they would lose profitability in the short run and gain no competitive edge in the long run without excludability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concern of suboptimal level of R&D still holds even in partial excludability case. {cite:t}`Arrow_1962` and {cite:t}`Romer_1986` demonstrates that decentralized choices can lead to suboptimal level of research because private agents do not account for spillovers of knowledge. This problem leads to a new branch of models such as in {cite:t}`Barro_1990` which focuses on whether government spending can help fix market failure. ~~In order to test model robustness, empirical research on conditional convergence are conducted. {cite:t}`Barro_2015`.~~\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent theoretical research began to put more focus on heterogeneity of economic agents. {cite:t}`Arawatari_Hori_Mino_2023` proposed a heterogeneous-agents model that takes into account labor market heterogeneity. In his model, household agents exhibit varying levels of entrepreneurial ability, affecting their inclination to engage in innovation and their compensation. {cite:t}`Arawatari_Hori_Mino_2023`'s model consists of one closed economy and is calibrated to observe the impact of government expenditures on economic growth based on U.S. data.\n",
    "\n",
    "{cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017` presents another model which investigates the role of the international market in technology accumulation through a heterogenous-agent model with imperfect competition. Instead of modelling research as a separate sector as in {cite:t}`Romer_1990`, he assumed that research occurs inside each consumption-good firm. The specification implies that partial excludability must exist in the form of market power for consumption goods. Nonetheless, {cite:t}`Romer_1990` stated that such distinction is inconsequential to the result observed. {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`'s model also explicit identify the difference between innovation and imitation as two separate R&D choices; however, he assumes the ratio of of R&D spent on each category to be fixed and homogenous among all agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "I view this assumption as a significant simplification because firms may have heterogenous preferences on innovation and imitation. Since innovation involves high uncertainty, some might be drawn to the untapped potential, while others may choose to adopt existing technology from other firms instead. {source} Thus, this paper will provide an extension to {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017` through heterogenous R&D preference. In addition, many simplifying assumptions will be lifted and substituted with market-based mechanism."

    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The foundation of the model presented here is based primarily on a multi-country, multi-industry agent-based model by {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`, which is a derivative of Keynes+Schumpeter family of models in {cite:t}`Dosi_Fagiolo_Napoletano_Roventini_2013`. The model consists of $N$ economies (indexed by $i$) and $M$ industries (indexed by $h$), each with a representative capital-good sector. Finally, there are $S$ firms per industry per country. Every firm exhibit heterogeneity and operates imperfectly competitive in both domestically and internationally. Technological progress is modeled as labor augmenting and is Harrod Neutral. Technological growth can occur either due to innovation of new technology or imitation from other firms in the same industry. The latter acknowledges the partial-excludability of knowledge stock discussed in {cite:t}`Romer_1990` and allows for the possibility of convergence. In contrast to {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017` with infite supply of labor, I choose to restrict labor to a growth rate $n$. This approach is in line with both {cite:t}`Jones_1995`'s finding that the long-run growth rate is limited by exogenous population growth and {cite:t}`Romer_1990`'s related conclusion based on human capital growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Timeline of the events\n",
    "1. At the start of time step $t$, each firm $j$ plans its spending on wage expense, capital cost based on both past and expectation of future sales. The representative capital-good sector hires labor at the same national wage rate as consumption-good sector and produces capital as demanded by consumption-good firms.\n",
    "2. The remaining budget is spent on R&D operation either through innovation or imitation. If the operation is successful, the firm labor productivity will increase at time step $t+1$.\n",
    "3. Nominal wage and nominal exchange rates are set at national level.\n",
    "4. Workers spend their wage income on consumption-good in an imperfectly competitive international market. The real exchange rate of each country and its firms' monopoly power evolve based on their price competitiveness.\n",
    "5. Entry and exit of firms are determined by their monopoly power.\n",

Here, we follow {cite:t}`Romer_1990`'s approach of keeping constant returns only to capital and labor. This choice is motivated by standard replication argument. Therefore, the Cobb-Douglas production function is:\n",

After each timestep, their productivity evolve corresponding to how much was invested into R&D on the previous timestep. At the end of each cycle, total profits (net R&D spending) are calculated, and the firms will bottom 10 percentile profits made are eliminated the market.
