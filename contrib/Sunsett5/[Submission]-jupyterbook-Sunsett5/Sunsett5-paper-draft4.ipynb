    "## Abstract\n",
    "The study extends the scope of evolutionary economics to the study of competition and convergence.  Building on the seminal work by {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017` in the field of evolutionary economics, this paper introduces the overlooked heterogeneity in R&D innovation and imitation routines. Models' parameters will be adjusted to study the underlying uncertainty of innovative R&D and the environment promotes convergence in an international market setting. Through Monte Carlo simulations, this research explores the implications of heterogeneity and its effect on decision-making and the dynamic competition among international firms. By addressing this important research gap, we aim to shed light on the nuanced dynamics that govern economic growth and demonstrate the importance of heterogeneity in evolutionary models."

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "{cite:t}`Romer_1990`'s endogenous growth model introduces novel perspectives on long-term growth in total factor productivity through technological advancement. In this model, a separate research and development (R&D) sector employs labor and capital resources to generate knowledge. Its partial excludability implies that other firms may replicate such technology with less time and resources spent on R&D. At the aggregate level, less technologically advanced countries can catch up with more advanced economies through the process known as \"convergence\" ({cite:t}`Barro_2015`).\n",
    "\n",
    "To observe the convergence mechanism, {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017` employs a multi-country, multi-industry agent-based model based on evolutionary models by {cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982`. Their model incorporates heterogeneous firms from different countries and industries, engaging in a competitive international market. The open economy feature illustrates how countries exploit technology gaps, shedding light on the process by which convergence, divergence, or polarization into low- and high-growth economies takes place. However, one aspect that has remained relatively unexplored is the profit-maximizing choices between two main R&D operations: innovation and imitation, as defined in the Bass diffusion model {cite:t}`Bass_1969`. Every firm in the model is assumed to spend a fixed and equal portion of their revenues on innovation and imitation. This approach has two main limitations: 1. It ignores the heterogeneity of firms. Some firms might aim to innovate continually, pushing the frontier to gain temporary benefits from partially-excludable knowledge. Other firms might instead employ a \"fast-second\" strategy and focus on replicating existing technology ({cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982`). 2. In different market conditions, firms' optimal investment behaviors are likely to differ. Through variation and subsequent natural selection, the optimal solutions at the dynamic equilibrium are expected to be nonstationary.\n",
    "\n",
    "This research aims to address this gap by employing a heterogeneous-agents evolutionary model that recognizes the heterogeneity of R&D routines. The evolutionary framework is based on {cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982`, while the dynamics of market share and international competition are derived from {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`. In contrast to {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`'s focus on naturally emerging divergence, my model will introduce heterogeneity in both productivity and initial R&D routines (choices between innovation and imitation). Over time, Schumpeterian dynamic competition will allow only the most profitable firms to survive natural selection ({cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing this feature of evolutionary economics, I can analyze two aspects of economic growth that are not feasible in representative-agent neoclassical models. First, firms' routines or decision-making is determined endogenously, allowing them to search for more optimal strategies as the settings evolve over time. It can be shown that ignoring possible heterogeneity in R&D routines would result in firms not making optimal decisions based on individual circumstances. Second, the evolutionary process takes into account the dynamic adjustment process leading to equilibrium. This paper will further show that the degree of convergence at equilibrium is both path-dependent and directly influenced by international competition between firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since imperfect competition gives rise to heterogeneous market power and profitability, this paper aims to demonstrate how market concentration, as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), influences convergence. By introducing this new dimension of factors that affect innovation tendency, I aim to illuminate the nuanced dynamics underlying economic growth and identify potential sources for the observed divergence in cross-country empirical studies. Finally, the results will serve as theoretical evidence of the importance of heterogeneity in endogenous growth models and its impacts on innovation, competition, long-term productivity growth, and convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this work is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces seminal works in the field of economic growth and the motivation behind revolutionary models that this paper is based on. In Section 3, the model is presented. Simulation results are analyzed in Section 4, and Section 5 concludes the theoretical findings."

    "## 2. Literature Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the same levels of labor and capital, modern economies can produce much more efficiently than their historical counterparts due to improvements in total factor productivity (TFP). The seminal works of economists in the 1950s attributed much of this growth to technological advancement ({cite:t}`Schultz_Abramovitz_1957`; {cite:t}`Kendrick_1956`; {cite:t}`Solow_1956`). Despite acknowledging technology as the primary driver of long-run growth, technology was still often considered exogenously based on empirical observation. In contrast to these earlier approaches, more recent models, notably {cite:t}`Romer_1990`'s endogenous technological change model, have internalized technology as a consequence of profit-maximizing economic agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "{cite:t}`Romer_1990`'s work formalized the partial excludability of knowledge, implying that newly created knowledge can be leveraged by other agents without infringing on intellectual property rights. The protection, including patents, copyright, and trade secrets, serves to incentivize innovation. Without some degree of excludability, firms would lack the incentive to engage in research ({cite:t}`Romer_1990`). Consequently, this property also means that knowledge cannot be modeled with a perfectly competitive market as firms would not be able to afford costs higher than the market marginal cost of production.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the positive externality of knowledge spillovers allows developing countries to catch up with their technologically advanced counterparts by imitating advanced technologies. However, the empirical support for this catch-up process, termed \"convergence,\" is not as robust as conventional theory would suggest, as revealed in {cite:t}`Johnson_Papageorgiou_2020`'s survey of convergence literature spanning five decades. Several studies have sought to identify the critical institutional factors that might influence convergence. For instance, {cite:t}`Barro_Sala-i-Martin_2014` examined a panel of 88 countries, investigating 67 explanatory variables frequently utilized in empirical growth literature. Apart from identifying factors affecting convergence, he also found that the significance of each variable is subject to the chosen functional forms and the set of variables under consideration. Particularly, the inclusion of country fixed effects could alter the significance level of multiple factors, implying that a large portion of the technological gap is still unexplained.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reconcile these observations, some scholars have delved into the microfoundation of firms' profit-maximizing R&D behaviors. {cite:t}`Arrow_1962` and {cite:t}`Romer_1990` highlight that decentralized choices can lead to suboptimal research levels due to the neglect of knowledge spillovers. {cite:t}`Barro_2015` explore whether government spending could remedy this market failure. Recognizing that economic agents may have differing intrinsic preferences, recent theoretical research has increasingly focused on the heterogeneity of economic agents. {cite:t}`Arawatari_Hori_Mino_2023` proposed a heterogeneous-agents model considering labor market heterogeneity, where household agents exhibit varying levels of entrepreneurial ability. While such models can extract analytical solutions of endogenous growth, they are limited by a number of simplifying assumptions that might not hold in different settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of studying heterogeneous R&D routines, I will follow {cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982`'s simulation-based analysis, which allows heterogeneous agents to be modeled without explicitly solving for analytical solutions. Another recent work by {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017` also employs evolutionary models but extends the model by incorporating the role of the international market and the dynamics of market share. Despite the overall heterogeneity of the model, the ratio of R&D spent on each category is assumed to be fixed and homogeneous among all agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simplification is significant because firms' preferences on innovation and imitation could depend on their size, as proposed by {cite:t}`Schumpeter_1950`. Since innovation involves high uncertainty, some might be drawn to the untapped potential, while others may choose to adopt existing technology from other firms instead. Additionally, as the landscape evolves, firms may have different optimal routines and will need to adjust accordingly. Thus, this paper will provide an extension to {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017` in the form of heterogeneous R&D preferences. The innovation and imitation mechanism follows {cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982`, while the market share dynamics are simplified from {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the inclusion of heterogeneity in R&D routines and market share dynamics allows us to observe the effect of international competition under different settings. It may be true that the possibility of gaining temporary market power over other firms motivates innovation in the first place, and competition ensures that firms will need to keep innovating. Nonetheless, there might be settings where the outcome of competition leads to market structures that do not support pervasive innovation by all firms. As {cite:t}`Schumpeter_1950` argued that the rate of innovation is accelerated primarily with large firms with market power, it is possible for the equilibrium to consist of few innovators who dominate the market. To determine whether such a situation can occur under the evolutionary framework, this paper examines four settings with varying effectiveness of innovation and imitation operations."

    "## 3. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The model presented here is based primarily on the evolutionary model of economic growth by {cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982`, the innovation-imitation process of the Bass diffusion model ({cite:t}`Bass_1969`), and the {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`'s multi-country, multi-industry agent-based model. The original model by {cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982` is a variation of endogenous growth models that aims to determine optimal decisions through natural selection rather than analytically solving for profit-maximizing behavior at equilibrium, as in orthodox approaches. I adapted the model to include multiple economies with heterogeneous starting levels of total factor productivity to study the effect of R&D on convergence. The model consists of $N$ economies (indexed by $i$) with $S$ firms per country. The goods produced in this model are assumed to be the same kind; however, each firm possesses market power corresponding to their market share, and evolve according to their relative competitiveness as in {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`. Thus, the market is imperfectly competitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation is that technological growth results from either the innovation of new technology or the imitation of other firms in the same industry. The innovation process becomes dominant when firms have high market power and can exclusively profit from their private knowledge. This private benefit is offset by the imitation process, which reflects the partial-excludability of knowledge stock discussed in {cite:t}`Romer_1990` and allows for the possibility of economic convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Timeline of the events\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At the start of time step $t$, each firm $j$ generates revenue from its existing technology. The gross profit is spent on R&D operations, either through innovation or imitation, while the rest is recorded as net income.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If the R&D operation is successful, the firm's labor productivity will increase at time step $t+1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Firms' market share evolves as they discover new technology and can achieve more (or less) competitive pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. After a period of time, entry and exit of firms are determined by their discounted net profit margin, calculated from net income and revenue. Therefore, firms with high market power or high total factor productivity are most likely to stay in the industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Steps 1-3 are repeated until dynamic equilibrium is achieved. At this point, surviving firms are those with optimal investment routines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections will discuss the model framework in detail. The values of the constants used in this model are available in Appendix A1, while the code for replicating simulations in this paper is given in Appendix A2."

    "### The Model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1 Consumption-Good Production:** \n",
    "\n",
    "A common feature of economic growth models is an assumption of constant or increasing returns to factors of production ({cite:t}`Romer_1986`). In {cite:t}`Lucas_1988` and {cite:t}`Rebelo_1991`, constant returns to scale apply to both rival factors (labor $L$ and capital $K$) and nonrival factors (technology $A)$. However, I choose not to explicitly model the factors of production here as this paper intends to focus on innovation and imitation, the characteristics of which can be studied independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the efficiency of production depends only on the total factor productivity $(A)$, while revenue depends on the market share $(f)$ and mark-up $(m)$ on the cost of production. The revenue $(R)$ and gross profit $(G)$ for each time step are calculated as:\n",

I follow {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`'s approach of allocating a part of revenues to R&D spending with one important adjustment. Each firm is now given heterogeneous preferences on R&D spending $(\\rho, \\lambda)$ that can gradually adjust over time.\n",

    "\n",
    "Since the formulation of expectations in a heterogeneous agents model can be complicated to model and requires numerous assumptions, especially during the transition toward equilibrium ({cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982`), this paper does not attempt to derive an analytic solution to R&D decisions. Instead, Monte Carlo simulation is employed to measure the effectiveness of each R&D choice through a natural selection process, which will \"drive from an industry all but the efficient profit maximizers\" ({cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each firm is assigned a fixed proportion ($\\rho$) of revenue spent on R&D and ($\\lambda$) of which will be spent on innovation ($IN$). Both are drawn uniformly and independently from $U(0,1)$ at the start of the simulation. In the spirit of {cite:t}`Friedman_1953`, \"Let the apparent immediate determinant of business behavior be anything at all—habitual reaction, random chance, or whatnot. Whenever this determinant happens to lead to behavior consistent with rational and informed maximization of returns, the business will prosper and acquire resources with which to expand; whenever it does not, the business will tend to lose resources and can be kept in existence only by the addition of resources from outside.\" This uninformative prior of firms' distribution ensures that each set of decisions is uniformly considered. Then, the unprofitable ones are gradually eliminated and substituted with more profitable firms.\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "In line with {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`, the innovation and imitation processes are modeled as a two-step stochastic process. First, the success of innovation or imitation is drawn from $Bern(\\theta)$. The probabilities of success ($\\theta _\\text{IN}, \\theta_\\text{IM}$) are positively related to R&D expenditure. For the purpose of examining the setting in which innovation is relatively more effective than imitation and vice versa, the firms' search capabilities ($\\xi_{IN,IM} > 0$) are adjustable parameters.\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The equations above are modified from {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`, in that the success rates of R&D operations no longer depend on the nominal spending $IN$, $IM$ directly. In such a model, the R&D search procedure would be exponentially more successful as the economy grows larger (higher $A$), thereby reducing the impact of varying investment decisions (since $\\theta$ will be approaching 1 regardless of the decisions). Here, $\\theta$ depends on the R&D ratio $\\rho$, innovation ratio $\\lambda$, and the market share $f$ because larger firms benefit from economies of scale in knowledge production and possess superior management, financing, and risk-spreading ({cite:t}`Schumpeter_1950`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Firms with successful innovation learn a new production technique at time $t+1$. The productivity of the discovered technology ($A_{\\text{in}}$) is uncertain in nature:\n",

    "\n",
    "Firms with successful imitation will randomly copy another firm's productivity $(A_{\\text{IM}}(t+1))$. As in {cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982`, the probability to imitate a particular firm is directly proportional to the market share $f$ of the firms. Firms are assumed to search for \"widely used techniques\" as opposed to \"best practice\" and thus are more likely to learn the technology from dominant firms in the market ({cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982`). \n",
    "\n",
    "This is in line with the diffusion model in which firms can only discern the effectiveness of each technique through its apparent success. Consequently, a successful innovation will be noticeable to other firms only after it achieves lower cost and occupy higher market share over a period of time. The advantageous outcome of this assumption is that innovative firms have a longer time to monopolistically benefit from their own innovation. The imitation processes occur both domestically and internationally, although international imitation incurs a multiplicative penalty $\\epsilon > 1$ to the probability of being imitated. The challenge of imitating foreign techniques is further discussed in {cite:t}`Abramovitz_1986` and {cite:t}`Fagerberg_Godinho_2006`.\n",

In this study, some alternative specifications where firms only learn part of the technology gap upon imitation (cannot completely imitate another firm's total factor productivity) are also considered, but no significant effect on the convergence trend is found.\n",

    "### Search Capabilities (Effectiveness of Innovation and Imitation)\n",
    "\n",
    "The central goal of this paper is to study how heterogeneity affects R&D decision-making and competition. First, we will look at the heterogeneous R&D routines in settings with varying effectiveness of innovation and imitation. Each setting is characterized by the universal search capabilities $\\xi_{IN,IM}$ that determine the likelihood of successful innovation and imitation. [Figure 1](f_survive_10_20_40_11_100_100_50-fig), [Figure 2](f_survive_10_20_40_11_100_20_50-fig), [Figure 3](f_survive_10_20_40_11_20_100_50-fig), and [Figure 4](f_survive_10_20_40_11_20_20_50-fig) show the posterior distribution of firms' R&D routines for the four settings from four individual simulations. The left figures represent the dynamic equilibrium where each firm is making optimal decisions given the characteristics $(A,\\rho,\\lambda,f,m)$ of each firm in the market. Cleary, the system exhibit heterogeneous routines at equilibium, and different settings result in different sets of routines. The right figures show the evolution of the national average productivity (colors are used to designate countries of origin, while the marker size represents the market share of individual firms).\n",

    "The right figure shows a small number of countries gain technological advancement at rates far greater than other countries, revealing a strong sign of divergence. The left figure shows that the advanced economies are actually dominated by few highly successful firms which form an oligopoly or monopoly market structure. An interesting observation is that the such firms need not be dedicated R&D spenders (as indicated by low $\\rho$). This result can be explained by their high market shares which allow them to not only gain more net income but also have more budget to reinvest. Despite spending only a small fraction on R&D, they effectively invest more due to economies of scale from the large firm size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the divergence can be attributed to two separate but connected mechanisms. First, imitation is ineffective in this setting, so it is unlikely for firms to catch up with early leaders. With this early advantage in productivity, the early leaders snowball into internationally dominant firms. At this point, the secondary effect kicks in through market power. Regardless of the R&D decisions, other firms will continue to be less and less likely to catch up due to limited market share.\n",

    "### Market Concentration\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in setting 2 of the previous section, market power is a significant driver of idiosyncratic economic growth and divergence. To measure how market concentration evolves over time, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) is calculated after each time step. In the context of the international market, HHI is defined here as an index that measures whether firms from any countries dominate the competition. This definition intentionally omits capturing the disparity of market share in a domestic economy because the focus here is on the convergence effect occurring at the aggregate level.\n",

    "Similar to setting 1, HHI gradually trends upward over time but with an upper bound approaching 1 (monopoly). This trend is expected because the ineffectiveness of R&D leads to less variation in technology. Rarely, a few firms can successfully innovate and expand their market shares. In this case, the low probability of successful imitation ensures that those firms will be hard to catch up with, resulting in a highly concentrated market similar to setting 2."

    "### $β$-convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous section discussed convergence qualitatively. In this section, I will turn to simulation-based measurements of $β$-convergence and investigate the relationship between market concentration and $β$-convergence. At the end of each cycle, the national average productivity growth rate is regressed against the initial productivity of each cycle. The coefficient of regression ($\\beta$) represents the degree of convergence in the global economy. A negative $β$-coefficient indicates faster growth in less technologically advanced economies, signaling convergence. [Figure 9](beta_500_10_20_40_11_100_100_50-fig), [Figure 10](beta_500_10_20_40_11_100_20_50-fig), [Figure 11](beta_500_10_20_40_11_20_100_50-fig), and [Figure 12](beta_500_10_20_40_11_20_20_50-fig) show the sequential estimation of $β$-convergence after each cycle for 500 simulations, with Monte Carlo 95% confidence intervals in grey.\n",

    "Although the estimated $β$-convergence seems to approach zero over time in the same manner as {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`'s result, I choose not to conclude that $β$-convergence does not occur. On the contrary, it can be argued that the global economy has already converged to its maximum convergence potential given by the imitation mechanism. To demonstrate this, the right figures show the corresponding decline in coefficients of variation of log(productivity) for each setting.\n",

    "The innovation-dominant setting is unique from other cases in that convergence does not exist (a positive $β$ signifies divergence). On the surface, this is due to ineffective imitation. Nonetheless, this situation is different from that of [Figure 12](beta_500_10_20_40_11_20_20_50-fig) because innovation is more effective here and can lead to superior growth in a small subset of firms, as seen in the HHI plot ([Figure 6](HHI_500_10_20_40_11_100_20_50-fig)). The divergence then becomes more apparent due to the disparity of firms' size and market power that hinders other firms from innovating, imitating, or catching up with them.

    "Out of the four settings, convergence is the strongest when imitation is dominant. Furthermore, convergence is more persistent. Since most firms are not dedicated innovators, and those that do are often ineffective, economic growth on the aggregate level can only occur when a rare innovator succeeds, and others all quickly imitate this temporarily successful innovative firm. Therefore, sustained economic growth requires continuous imitation over time, and thus $β$-convergence approaches zero significantly slower.\n",

    "Similar to the first setting, convergence is most prevalent when there is a higher variation of productivity between nations. However, due to the ineffectiveness of imitation, convergence starts at a lower level than [Figure 9](beta_500_10_20_40_11_100_100_50-fig) and persists for a longer period of time, meaning the period of catching-up takes longer. Combined with exogenous structural shocks to other aspects of the economy that could affect productivity growth, the technological gap in this environment might never be closed for any prolonged period of time.\n",

    "Next, the linear relationship between $β$-convergence and HHI is studied. As seen in previous sections, both HHI and $β$-convergence exhibit a strong trend, thus we employ a panel regression analysis. Each simulation is treated as separate entities, while each cycle (consisting of $T$ time steps) is treated as separate time periods. $β$-convergence is regressed against the average HHI of the same cycle. Time fixed effects are included to address the trends of both variables. The regression coefficient $γ$ and its standard errors are displayed in the table below. Note that the P-value is almost 0 since this panel regression is performed on the simulated panel and not empirical data.\n",

    "The positive coefficient of regression $(γ)$ means that the degree of convergence is lower in a high market concentration setting. {cite:t}`Schumpeter_1950` describes the relationship between market share and innovation as follows: larger firms are the main force of innovation, while smaller firms struggle to keep up. Thus, when market concentration (HHI) increases, one would expect innovation to be concentrated among top performers in the international market, leading to divergence (positive beta) and positive $γ$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The panel regression result supports this thesis for three out of four settings with a positive $γ$, however, through a different explanation. Although $γ$ is positive in setting 1 (0.0154) with dominant innovation, its magnitude is smaller than that of setting 3 (0.0272). In other words, a highly concentrated market can lead to divergence through disproportionate innovation as expected, but the effect is stronger through imitation process. The positive $γ$ in 3 settings means that a highly competitive market is beneficial to long-term convergence through imitation, and to a lesser extent, innovation. The interpretation for negative $γ$ is less trivial, as [Figure 6](HHI_500_10_20_40_11_100_20_50-fig) and [Figure 2](f_survive_10_20_40_11_100_20_50-fig) clearly show that the market has become an oligopoly or a monopoly. The equilibrium then consists of a few firms competing, and the dynamics can no longer be accurately captured by $β$-convergence or HHI."

    "## 5. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper extends {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`'s endogenous growth model by incorporating the heterogeneity of R&D routines discussed in {cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982`'s seminal work. The significance of this modification becomes evident in the posterior distributions of firms' routines, which heavily depend on the effectiveness of R&D operations. The evolution of the market through international competition reveals varying degrees of competitiveness, ranging from highly competitive equilibria to settings resulting in oligopoly or monopoly markets. The resulting market concentration affects the degree of $β$-convergence model since each firm's market share directly influence its capacity to invest in R&D.\n",
    "\n",
    "A highly competitive market, measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), ensures that each firm has a comparable chance of successfully innovating or imitating, the latter contributing significantly to long-term $β$-convergence. The relationship emerges from Monte Carlo average; however, each simulation yields highly stochastic results due to the inherent uncertainty of R&D operations. Consequently, the final state can become highly path-dependent. Even firms with low R&D tendencies can emerge as dominant innovators if they successfully innovate early on, gain market power, and block other firms from competing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this paper underscores the importance of economic agents' routine heterogeneity and the path-dependence inherent in evolutionary models. It serves as a foundation for motivating more detailed or expansive models and invites empirical testing against other endogenous growth models to assess its predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several avenues for model improvement exist, including alternative equation forms or expansions to capture additional aspects of the economy. While model's simplicity allows for a focused examination of innovation, competition, and convergence dynamics, its realism is constrained by scope. {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`'s model, as a key reference, exemplifies expansive models capturing capital stock, international trade, prices, wages, and the labor market. Combining the heterogeneity of this paper with the broader economic framework might yield a more accurate model compared to empirical data, albeit at the cost of increased complexity and potential loss of tractability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the current model scope, the imitation mechanism appears as the weakest assumption. Varying the imitation process could reveal nuanced relationships between market concentration, convergence, and R&D. Further modifications to the search mechanism or market share dynamics are also potential areas for refinement. The choice of modifications would then depend on the model's purpose and its performance in capturing historical growth data as well as predicting future movements."
