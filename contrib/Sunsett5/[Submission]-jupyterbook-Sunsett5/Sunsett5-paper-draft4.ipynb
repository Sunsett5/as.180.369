    "## Abstract\n",
    "The study extends the scope of evolutionary economics to the study of competition and convergence. While the concept of endogenous growth driven by the R&D sector has been extensively studied, the majority of pioneering works, such as {cite:t}`Romer_1990`, have been grounded in the assumption of homogeneous research products. Building on the seminal work by {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017` in the field of evolutionary economics, this paper introduces the overlooked heterogeneity in R&D innovation and imitation routines. Models' parameters will be adjusted to study the underlying uncertainty of innovative R&D and the environment in which convergence is feasible in an international market setting. Through Monte Carlo simulations, this research explores the implications of heterogeneity and its effect on decision-making and the dynamic competition among international firms. By addressing this important research gap, we aim to shed light on the nuanced dynamics that govern economic growth and demonstrate the importance of heterogeneity in evolutionary models."

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "{cite:t}`Romer_1990`'s endogenous growth model introduces new ways of looking at long-term growth in total factor productivity through technological advancement. In his model, a seperate sector of research and development (R&D) utilizes labor and capital resources to produce knowledge. Its partial excluadablity means that other firms might be able to replicate such technology with less time and resource spent in R&D. At the aggregrate level, less technologically advanced countries are expected to catch up with more advanced economies through the process known as \"convergence\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To observe the convergence mechanism and compare its with stylized facts, {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017` employs a multi-country, multi-industry agent-based model based on evolutionary models by {cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982`. Dosi et al's model incorporates heterogeneous firms from different countries and industries, engaging in competitive international trade. In contrast to {cite:t}`Romer_1990`, the multi-sectoral framework facilitates the observation of path-dependent structural changes. Additionally, the open economy feature illustrates how countries exploit technology gaps, shedding light on the process by which convergence, divergence, or polarization into low- and high-growth economies takes place. {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017` make valuable contributions to endogenous growth theories, introducing heterogeneity of market power and the dynamics of international competition. Yet, one aspect that has remained relatively unexplored is the concious choice between two main R&D operations: innovating and imitating as defined in the Bass diffusion model {cite:t}`Bass_1969`. \n",
    "\n",
    "In {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`'s model, every firm in the model is assumed to spend a fixed and equal portion of their revenues on innovation and imitation. This approach has two limitations: 1. It ignores the heterogeneity of firms. Some firms might aim to innovate and constantly push the frontier to gain temporary benefits from partially-excludable knowledge. Other firms might instead employ a \"fast-second\" strategy and focus on replicating existing technology ({cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982`). 2. In different market conditions, firms' optimal investment behaviors are likely to differ. Through variation and subsequent natural selection, the optimal solutions at the dynamic equilibrium can be determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "This research aims to address this gap by employing an heterogenous-agents evolutionary model based on {cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982`, augmented by {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`'s dynamic of market share and international competition. In contrast to {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`'s focus on naturally emerging divergence, my model will introduce heterogeneity in both productivity and initial R&D routines (choices between innovation and imitation). Over time, the Schumpeterian dynamic competition will allow only the most profitable firms to suvive natural selection ({cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing this aspect of evolutionary economics, I can analyzes two aspects of economic growth that are not feasible in representative-agent neoclassical models. First, firms' routines or decision making are determined endogenously which allow them to search for more optimal strategies as the settings evolve over time. Second, the evolutionary process take into account the dynamic adjustment process leading to equilibrium. This paper will further show that the degree of convergence at equilibrium are both path dependent and are directly influenced by international competition between firms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since imperfect competition gives rise to heterogenous market power and profitability, this paper aims to demonstrate how market concentration, as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), influences convergence. By introducing this new dimension of factors that afftect innovation tendency, I aim to illuminate the nuanced dynamics underlying economic growth and identify potential sources for the observed divergence in cross-country empirical studies. Finally, the results will serve as a theoretical evidence to the importance of heterogeneity in an endogenous growth models and its impacts on innovation, competition, long-term productivity growth, and convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this work is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces seminal works in the field of economic growth and the motivation behind revolutionary models that this paper is based on. In Section 3, the model is presented. Simulation results are analyzed in Section 4, and Section 5 concludes the theoretical findings. "

    "## 2. Literature Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the same level of labor and capital, modern economies can produce much more efficiently than their historical counterparts due to improvements in total factor productivity (TFP). Economists in the 1950s attributed most of this growth to technological advancement ({cite:t}`Schultz_Abramovitz_1957`; {cite:t}`Kendrick_1956`; {cite:t}`Solow_1956`). Despite acknowledging technology as primary driver of long-run growth, early economic models continued to treat it as an exogenous factor, requiring empirical observation. In contrast to these earlier approaches, more recent models, notably {cite:t}`Romer_1990`'s endogenous technological change model, have internalized technology as a consequence of profit-maximizing economic agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "His paper formalized the partial excludability of knowledge. Upon creation of new knowledge, other agents can utilize this spillover knowledge to advance their own research and innovation to the extent of not infringing on intellectual property rights.\n",
    "\n",
    "On one hand, the protection in the forms of patents, copyright, trade secrets, industrial design rights, database rights, etc. exists to provide incentives to innovators. {cite:t}`Romer_1990` explains that without some degree of excludablity, firms will not be incentived to engage in research in the first place. Consequently, models with perfectly competitive markets would not function properly with knowledge production because they cannot afford to incur cost higher than the market marginal cost of production. In this paper, the effect of obstacles to imitation is studied through both the success rate of imitation and the challenge of finding the right firms to imitate.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the positive externality enables developing countries to catch up with their technologically advanced counterparts by \"imitating\" their advanced technologies. The process of catching-up or \"Convergence,\" has, however, not found strong empirical support. In {cite:t}`Johnson_Papageorgiou_2020`'s comprehensive survey of convergence literature spanning the last five decades, the income gap between poorer and richer countries has shown more persistence than conventional theory would suggest. Several studies have sought to identify the critical institutional factors that might influence convergence. For instance, {cite:t}`Barro_Sala-i-Martin_2014` examined a panel of 88 countries, investigating 67 explanatory variables frequently utilized in empirical growth literature. \n",
    "\n",
    "To explain such empirical observations, one approach is through the microfoundation of firms' profit-maximizing R&D behaviors. {cite:t}`Arrow_1962` and {cite:t}`Romer_1990` demonstrates that decentralized choices can lead to suboptimal level of research because private agents do not account for spillovers of knowledge. This problem leads to a new branch of models such as in {cite:t}`Barro_1990` which focuses on whether government spending can help fix market failure. \n",
    "\n",
    "This paper presents an evolutionary model for the roles of R&D and international competition. The two factors are connected through the partial-excluablity property of knowledge. It is the possiblity of gaining temporary market power over other firms that drive innovation in the first place, and competition ensures that firms will need to keep innovating. Nonetheless, the situation of pervasive innovation and competition might not hold true as {cite:t}`Schumpeter_1950` argued that the rate of innovation is accelerated primary with large firms with market power. Thus, it is possible for the equilibrium to consist of few innovators who dominate the market. This will be one of the situations that my model aims to capture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent theoretical research began to put more focus on heterogeneity of economic agents. {cite:t}`Arawatari_Hori_Mino_2023` proposed a heterogeneous-agents model that takes into account labor market heterogeneity. In his model, household agents exhibit varying levels of entrepreneurial ability, affecting their inclination to engage in innovation and their compensation. Although the emphasis on heterogeneity and microfoundation of economic models were quite recent, seminal works such as {cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982` had long paved the way for simulation-based analysis consisting of heterogenous agents. Firms in his model follow {cite:t}`Bass_1969`'s diffusion model and are given individual routines whether to innovate new technology or imitate other firms in the industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "{cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017` presents an extension to the model by including the role of the international market in technology accumulation through a heterogenous-agent model with imperfect competition. Instead of modelling research as a separate sector as in {cite:t}`Romer_1990`, he assumed that research occurs inside each consumption-good firm. The specification implies that partial excludability must exist in the form of market power for consumption goods. {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`'s model also explicit identify the difference between innovation and imitation as two separate R&D choices; however, the ratio of of R&D spent on each category is assumed to be fixed and homogenous among all agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simplification is significant because firms' preferences on innovation and imitation could depend on its size as proposed by {cite:t}`Schumpeter_1950`. Since innovation involves high uncertainty, some might be drawn to the untapped potential, while others may choose to adopt existing technology from other firms instead. Additionally, as the landscape evolves, firms may have different optimal routines and will have to adjust accordingly. Thus, this paper will provide an extension to {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017` in the form of heterogenous R&D preferences. The innovation and imitation mechanism follows both {cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982`, while the market share dynamics is simplified from {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`."

    "## 3. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The model presented here is based primarily on the evolutionary model of economic growth by {cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982`, the innovation-imitation process of the Bass diffusion model ({cite:t}`Bass_1969`), and the {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`'s multi-country, multi-industry agent-based model. The original model by {cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982` is a variation of endogenous growth models that aims to determine optimal decisions through natural selection rather than analytically solving for profit-maximizing behavior at equilibrium, as in orthodox approaches. I adapted the model to include multiple economies with heterogeneous starting levels of total factor productivity to study the effect of R&D on convergence. The model consists of $N$ economies (indexed by $i$) with $S$ firms per country. The goods produced in this model are assumed to be the same kind; however, each firm possesses market power corresponding to their market share, and evolve according to their relative competitiveness as in {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`. Thus, the market is imperfectly competitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation is that technological growth can occur either due to the innovation of new technology or imitation from other firms in the same industry. The innovation process becomes dominant when firms have high market power and can exclusively profit from their private knowledge. This private benefit is offset by the imitation process, which reflects the partial-excludability of knowledge stock discussed in {cite:t}`Romer_1990` and allows for the possibility of economic convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Timeline of the events\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At the start of time step $t$, each firm $j$ generates revenue from its existing technology. The gross profit is spent on R&D operations, either through innovation or imitation, while the rest is recorded as net income.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If the R&D operation is successful, the firm's labor productivity will increase at time step $t+1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Firms' market share evolves as they discover new technology and can achieve more (or less) competitive pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. After a period of time, entry and exit of firms are determined by their discounted net profit margin, calculated from net income and revenue. Therefore, firms with high market power or high total factor productivity are most likely to stay in the industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Steps 1-3 are repeated until dynamic equilibrium is achieved. At this point, surviving firms are those with optimal investment routines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections will discuss the model framework in detail. The values of the constants used in this model are available in Appendix A1, while the code for replicating simulations in this paper is given in Appendix A2."

    "### The Model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1 Consumption-Good Production:** \n",
    "\n",
    "A common feature of economic growth models is an assumption of constant or increasing returns to factors of production ({cite:t}`Romer_1986`). In {cite:t}`Lucas_1988` and {cite:t}`Rebelo_1991`, constant returns to scale apply to both rival factors (labor $L$ and capital $K$) and nonrival factors (technology $A)$. However, I choose not to explicitly model the factors of production here as this paper intends to focus on innovation and imitation, the characteristics of which can be studied independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the efficiency of production depends only on the total factor productivity $(A)$, while revenue depends on the market share $(f)$ and mark-up $(m)$ on the cost of production. The revenue $(R)$ and gross profit $(G)$ for each time step are calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "R &= (1+m)fA \\\\\n",
    "G &= mfA\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to the \"learning by doing\" model by {cite:t}`Arrow_1962`, knowledge is not automatically generated through production in this model. I follow {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`'s approach of allocating a part of revenues to R&D spending with one important adjustment. Each firm is now given heterogeneous preferences on R&D spending $(\\rho, \\lambda)$ that can gradually adjust over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\rho$ be the portion of gross profit spent on R&D investments, and $\\lambda$ of which is through innovation. Then, the total revenue $R$ is allocated in the following ways: 1. Net Income $(NI)$ 2. Innovation Spending $(IN)$ and 3. Imitation Spending $(IM)$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Since the formulation of expectations in a heterogeneous agents model can be complicated to model and requires numerous assumptions, especially during the transition toward equilibrium ({cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982`), this paper does not attempt to derive an analytic solution to R&D decisions. Instead, Monte Carlo simulation is employed to measure the effectiveness of each R&D choice through a natural selection process, which will \"drive from an industry all but the efficient profit maximizers\" ({cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each firm is assigned a fixed proportion ($\\rho$) of revenue spent on R&D and ($\\lambda$) of which will be spent on innovation ($IN$). Both are drawn uniformly and independently from $U(0,1)$ at the start of the simulation. In the spirit of {cite:t}`Friedman_1953`, \"Let the apparent immediate determinant of business behavior be anything at all—habitual reaction, random chance, or whatnot. Whenever this determinant happens to lead to behavior consistent with rational and informed maximization of returns, the business will prosper and acquire resources with which to expand; whenever it does not, the business will tend to lose resources and can be kept in existence only by the addition of resources from outside.\" This uninformative prior of firms' distribution ensures that most of the possible decisions are first considered. Then, the unprofitable ones are gradually eliminated and substituted with more profitable firms.\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "In line with {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`, the innovation and imitation processes are modeled as a two-step stochastic process. Firstly, the success of innovation or imitation is drawn from $Bern(\\theta)$. The probabilities of success ($\\theta _\\text{IN}, \\theta \\text{IM}$) are positively related to R&D expenditure. In order to study the environment in which innovation is relatively more successful than imitation and vice versa, the firms' search capabilities ($\\xi{1,2} > 0$) are adjustable.\n",

    "\\theta _\\text{IM} &= 1-\\exp\\bigl[-\\xi_2 f \\rho (1-\\lambda)\\bigl]\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The equations above are modified from {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`, in that the success rate of R&D no longer depends on the spending $IN$, $IM$ directly. In such a model, the R&D search procedure will be exponentially more successful as the economy grows larger (higher $A$), thereby reducing the impact of varying investment decisions since $\\theta$ will be approaching 1 regardless of the decisions. Here, $\\theta$ depends on the R&D ratio $\\rho$, innovation ratio $\\lambda$, and the market share $(f)$ since larger firms benefit from economies of scale in knowledge production and possess superior management, financing, and risk-spreading ({cite:t}`Schumpeter_1950`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The firm with successful innovation learns a new production technique at time $t+1$. The productivity of the discovered technology ($A_{\\text{in}}$) is uncertain in nature:\n",

    "\n",
    "A firm with successful imitation will randomly copy another firm's productivity. As in {cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982`, the probability to imitate a particular firm is proportional to the market share $f$ of the firms. Firms are assumed to look for \"widely used techniques\" as opposed to \"best practice\" and thus are more likely to learn the technology from dominant firms in the market ({cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982`). This is in line with the models of diffusion in which firms can only discern the effectiveness of each technique through its apparent success. Consequently, a successful innovation will only be noticeable to other firms when it is able to reduce cost and occupy a higher market share over a period of time. The advantageous outcome of this assumption is that innovative firms have a longer time to monopolistically benefit from their own innovation. The imitation processes occur both domestically and internationally, although international imitation incurs a multiplicative penalty $\\epsilon > 1$ to the probability of being imitated. The challenge of imitating foreign techniques is further discussed in {cite:t}`Abramovitz_1986` and {cite:t}`Fagerberg_Godinho_2006`.\n",

    "Finally, the firm compares its newly acquired techniques from innovation or imitation with its existing techniques and chooses to adopt the one with the highest productivity. In this study, some alternative specifications where firms only learn part of the technology gap upon imitation (cannot completely imitate another firm's total factor productivity) are also considered, but no significant effect on the convergence trend is found.\n",

The first factor that can be manipulated exogenously is the effectiveness of innovation and imitation. Each firm is given identical search capabilities that determine the likelihood of successful innovation and imitation.

In other words, a highly concentrated market can lead to divergence through disproportionate innovation as expected, but the effect is more stronger through imitation. The positive $γ$ in 3 settings leads to a conclusion that a highly competitive market is beneficial to long-term convergence through imitation, and to a lesser extent, innovation. The interpretation for negative $γ$ is less trivial, as [Figure 6](HHI_500_10_20_40_11_100_20_50-fig) and [Figure 2](f_survive_10_20_40_11_100_20_50-fig) clearly show that the market has become oligopolistic. The equilibrium then consists of a few firms competing, and the dynamics can no longer be accurately captured by $β$-convergence or HHI."

    "## 5. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper extends {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`'s endogenous growth model by incorporating the heterogeneity of R&D routines discussed in {cite:t}`Nelson_Winter_1982`'s seminal work. The significance of this modification becomes evident in the posterior distributions of firms' routines, which heavily depend on the effectiveness of R&D operations. The evolution of the market through international competition reveals varying degrees of competitiveness, ranging from highly competitive equilibria to settings resulting in oligopoly markets. The resulting market concentration affects the degree of $β$-convergence model since each firm's market share directly influence its capacity to invest in R&D.\n",
    "\n",
    "A highly competitive market, measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), ensures each firm has a comparable chance of successfully innovating or imitating, the latter contributing significantly to long-term β-convergence. The relationship emerges from Monte Carlo average; however, each simulation yields highly stochastic results due to the inherent uncertainty of R&D operations. The final state can then become highly path-dependent. Even firms with low R&D tendencies can emerge as dominant industry innovators if they successfully innovate early on, gain market power, and block other firms from competing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this paper underscores the importance of economic agents' routine heterogeneity and the path-dependence inherent in evolutionary models. It serves as a foundation for motivating more detailed or expansive models and invites empirical testing against other endogenous growth models to assess its predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several avenues for model improvement exist, including alternative equation forms or expansions to capture additional aspects of the economy. Within the current model scope, the imitation mechanism appears as the weakest assumption. Varying the imitation process could reveal nuanced relationships between market concentration, convergence, and R&D. Further modifications to the search mechanism or market share dynamics also offer potential areas for refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the simplicity of the model allows for a focused examination of innovation, competition, and convergence dynamics, its realism is constrained by scope. {cite:t}`Dosi_Roventini_Russo_2017`'s model, as a key reference, exemplifies expansive models capturing capital stock, international trade, prices, wages, and the labor market. Combining the heterogeneity of this paper with the broader economic framework might yield a more accurate model compared to empirical data, albeit at the cost of increased complexity and potential loss of tractability."
