**A Heterogeneous-agents Model of Economic Growth with Risk Averse Behavior**

The study extends the scope of existing heterogeneous-agents models in the field of endogenous growth. While the concept of endogenous growth driven by the R&D sector has been extensively studied, the majority of pioneering works, such as Romer (1990), have been grounded in the assumption of homogeneous research products. Building on recent contributions by Dosi et al. (2018), which introduced heterogeneity into R&D firms, this paper introduce overlooked heterogeneity in the form of risk-averse workers, each with distinct preferences for engaging in uncertain innovative work as opposed to employment in the consumer or capital goods sectors. Reflecting the underlying uncertainty of R&D sector experienced by every economic agent, the financial side of R & D is also modeled with heterogeneous risk-averse investors. Through Monte Carlo simulations, this research explores the implications of heterogeneity within these various agents on long-term productivity growth and convergence. By addressing this important research gap, we aim to shed light on the nuanced dynamics that govern economic growth and identify possible sources to divergence observed in cross-country empirical studies.

**Introduction**

Given the same level of labor and capital, countries today can produce much more efficiently than decades ago due to increased aggregate productivity of labor. Economist in the 1950s attributed most of this growth to technological advancement. (Abramovitz 1956; Kendrick 1956; Solow 1957). Earlier models regard technology as exogenous variable that has to be observed empirically; however, more recent models such as an endogenous technological change model by Romer (1990) internalize technological as a consequence of profit-maximizing economic agents.

In Romer (1990), R&D can be viewed as an alternative sector that employ labor and capital and output knowledge as a partially excludable good. In order to create knowledge, economy has to divert its human and capital stock from consumer goods and capital production, thereby sacrificing current consumption for future productivity growth. The distinct feature of knowledge, however, is that it is only partially excludable through intellectual property laws. Other agents can freely learn from the innovation and use the spillover knowledge to fuel their own research in a way that does not violate intellectual property laws. Although this positive externalities are beneficial to economic growth, profit-maximizing agents disregard social benefits of research and based its decision only on private its private benefits. This lead to two significant consequences. First, investment on capitals are too low, and researchers are employed at Pareto-inefficient levels (Fine, 2000). Second, less-technologically advanced countries can benefit from existing stock of knowledge created by developed countries without having to invest their own resources into R&D.

This advantage allow developing countries to catch up to the technologically-advanced countries. On the other hand, advanced economies operating at technological frontier should in theory experience a slowdown in growth and allow the gap between countries with different technological advancement to close over time. This so-called "convergence" of economic growth is, however, not well supported by empirical evidence. In the survey of convergence literature in the past five decades by Johnson and Papageorgiou (2020), the income gap between poorer and richer countries has generally been more persistent than the theory would suggest.

This led to a formulation of "conditional convergence," which states that two countries will only reach the same steady state of economic growth if their internal factors supporting economic growth are at the same level. Numerous studies attempt to determine the internal factors affecting steady state of economic growth. For example, Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2004, ch.12) used a panel of 88 countries examined 67 explanatory variables commonly used in empirical growth literature, including, life expectancy, fertility rate, rule of law index, education, investment ratio, level, government expenditure ratio, openness, terms-of-trade, inflation, democracy, etc. The significance of each variable depends greatly on the functional forms and the set of variables used (Barro, 2015). 

In order to bridge the gap between endogenous growth model and these empirical obsevations, Dosi et al. (2018) present a multi-country, multi-industry agent-based modeleconomic models with heterogeneous firms in different countries and industries and engage in competitive international trade. In contrast to Romer (1990), the multi-sectoral setting allows us to observe structural change, while the open economy feature directly shows how countries take advantage of technology-gaps and whether convergence, divergence, or polarization into low- and high- growth economies occur. In a similar manner, Arawatari (2023) proposed a heterogeneous-agents model that incorporates the heterogeneity of the labor market. In his model, household agents have heterogeneous entrepreneurial ability and thus have different threshold to engage in innovation as well as receiving different compensation.

Both models offer valuable contribution to endogenous growth models in terms of heterogeneity in firms and skills of workers. Nonetheless, a characteristic that remains modtly unexplored is the risk perception of research sector. Both workers and investors have to evaluate whether a particular R&D project in a specific sector will be successful and give them higher return compared to a more predictable consumer goods and capital sector. At the same time, research runs the risk of becoming obsolete sooner than expected ,or firms may research the same topics, leaving all profits to the first to discover. Since these risks are unobservable, risk-averse agents in financial markets and labor markets need to exercise judgement calls based on their heterogeneous abilities and risk tolerance. The choice agents make also depends on macroeconomic variables such as policy interest rate, world interest rate, inflation, political stability, and volatility of the market.

Through Monte Carlo simulations, this research explores the implications of heterogeneity within these various agents on long-term productivity growth and convergence. By introducing new dimension to the endogenous growth model with heterogeneous agents, we aim to shed light on the nuanced dynamics that govern economic growth and identify possible sources to divergence observed in cross-country empirical studies.
