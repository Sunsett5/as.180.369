**A Heterogeneous-agents Model of Endogeneous Growth with Risk Averse Behavior**

The study extends the scope of existing heterogeneous-agents models in the field of endogenous growth. While the concept of endogenous growth driven by the R&D sector has been extensively studied, the majority of pioneering works, such as Romer (1990), have been grounded in the assumption of homogeneous research products. Building on recent contributions by Dosi et al. (2018), which introduced heterogeneity into R&D firms, this paper introduce overlooked heterogeneity in the form of risk-averse workers, each with distinct preferences for engaging in uncertain innovative work as opposed to employment in the consumer or capital goods sectors. Reflecting the underlying uncertainty of R&D sector experienced by every economic agent, the financial side of R & D is also modeled with heterogeneous risk-averse investors. Through Monte Carlo simulations, this research explores the implications of heterogeneity within these various agents on long-term productivity growth and convergence. By addressing this important research gap, we aim to shed light on the nuanced dynamics that govern economic growth and identify possible sources to divergence observed in cross-country empirical studies.

**Introduction**

Given the same level of labor and capital, modern economies can produce much more efficiently than their historical counterparts due to an increase in total factor productivity (TFP). Economists in the 1950s attributed most of this growth to technological advancement. (Abramovitz 1956; Kendrick 1956; Solow 1957). Despite acknowledging technology as primary driver of long-run growth, early economic models continued to treat it as an exogenous factor, requiring empirical observation. However, in contrast to these earlier approaches, more recent models, notably Romer's endogenous technological change model (1990), have internalized technology as a consequence of profit-maximizing economic agents.

Romer's model introduces research and development (R&D) as an alternative sector which utilizes labor and capital resources to produce knowledge, a partially excludable good. Creating knowledge requires diverting human and capital stocks away from consumer goods and capital production. The economy in turn trades current consumption for future productivity growth. Knowledge, however, possesses a unique attribute separating it from consumer and capital goods â€“ it is only partially excludable due to intellectual property laws. Other agents can freely utilize this spillover knowledge to advance their own research, not infringing on intellectual property rights. This situation results in positive externalities that contribute to economic growth. Nonetheless, profit-maximizing agents, driven solely by private benefits, often disregard these broader social advantages. This leads to two noteworthy consequences: First, investments in capital are below optimal level, and the employment of researchers remains Pareto inefficient (Fine, 2000). Second, developing countries can capitalize on the existing knowledge created by more technologically-advanced nations without the need to invest significantly in their research and development.

This advantage enables developing countries to catch up with their technologically advanced counterparts. In theory, advanced economies operating at the technological frontier should experience a slowdown in growth, ultimately closing the gap between countries with varying levels of technological advancement. This concept, often referred to as "convergence" in economic growth, has, however, not found strong empirical support. In Johnson and Papageorgiou's (2020) comprehensive survey of convergence literature spanning the last five decades, the income gap between poorer and richer countries has shown more persistence than conventional theory would suggest.

In response to this challenge, the term of "conditional convergence" emerged, asserting that two countries will reach the same steady state of economic growth only if their internal factors supporting economic growth are aligned. Several studies have sought to identify these critical internal factors. For instance, Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2004, ch.12) examined a panel of 88 countries, investigating 67 explanatory variables frequently utilized in empirical growth literature. These variables encompass factors like life expectancy, fertility rates, rule of law indices, education, investment ratios, government expenditure ratios, openness, terms-of-trade, inflation, democracy, and more. The significance of each variable is subject to the chosen functional forms and the set of variables under consideration (Barro, 2015).

To bridge the gap between endogenous growth models and these empirical observations, Dosi et al. (2018) introduced a multi-country, multi-industry agent-based model. This model incorporates heterogeneous firms from different countries and industries, engaging in competitive international trade. In contrast to Romer (1990), the multi-sectoral framework facilitates the observation of structural changes. Additionally, the open economy feature illustrates how countries exploit technology gaps, shedding light on whether convergence, divergence, or polarization into low- and high-growth economies occurs. Similarly, Arawatari (2023) proposed a heterogeneous-agents model that takes into account labor market heterogeneity. In his model, household agents exhibit varying levels of entrepreneurial ability, affecting their inclination to engage in innovation and their compensation.

Both of these models make valuable contributions to endogenous growth theories, introducing heterogeneity among firms and the skills of workers. Yet, one aspect that has remained relatively unexplored is risk perceptions within the research sector. Workers and investors must assess whether a specific R&D project in a particular sector will yield a successful outcome and offer higher returns compared to more predictable consumer goods and capital sectors. Simultaneously, research projects may become obsolete sooner than anticipated, or multiple firms may focus on the same topics, leading to reduced profits for latecomers. As these risks are inherently unobservable, risk-averse agents in financial and labor markets must make judgment calls based on their distinct abilities and risk tolerances. The choices made by these agents are also influenced by macroeconomic variables, such as policy interest rates, world interest rates, inflation, political stability, and market volatility.

This research employs Monte Carlo simulations to explore the implications of heterogeneity within these diverse agents on long-term productivity growth and convergence. By introducing this new dimension of risk perception to heterogeneous agents in labor and financial markets, we aim to illuminate the nuanced dynamics underlying economic growth and identify potential sources for the observed divergence in cross-country empirical studies.
