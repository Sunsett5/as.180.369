Summary: "The Problem With Counterfeit People" by Daniel C. Dennett

As dangerous as money counterfeiting might have been in the past, faking people can be far more deadly to the future of human freedom. 
Current AI technology has already made it challenging for people, even the most skeptical ones, to distinguish AI expressions from those of actual humans.
A possible consequence of this breakthrough, as Dennett described, is the "[the destruction] of not just economies but human freedom itself."
Exploiting humans' natural tendency to imagine a person sitting across us in an online conversation, AI is able to feed in false information and manipulate people to make uninformed decisions.
One of these decisions could be related to government policies, and thus the democratic freedom of informed voters could be threatened.
While one important figure can persuade the crowd, AI technology has the ability to create new entities with better imitation.
This implication elevate the negative impact of counterfeit people and call for a higher degree of regulations.

Due to these consequences, Dennett expressed his view of seriously punishing related actors who facilitate or allow counterfeit people to roam the internet and manipulate actual human beings.
The regulation and penalties should be implemented in two parts. First, companies who have the capacity to create fake people with AI must include easily identifiable and permanent watermark
that tells people of its artificial nature. Second, companies who manufacture devices with access to online platforms must include a software that read this watermark and indentified those messages as artificial.
