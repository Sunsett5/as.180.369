    "All seven strategies proposed by Korinek for using AI in economic research are applicable to my work. I will focus on \"Mathematical Derivations\" because my research involves developing an advanced endogenous growth model and conducting Monte Carlo simulations. Previous literature presents varied frameworks and assumptions for endogenous growth models, necessitating a fresh perspective, such as shifting from a representative firm to a heterogeneous agents model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formulating equations that align with new assumptions and avoid contradictions is challenging. They must not only be compatible with existing literature but also computationally efficient, given the expected complexity of model parameters and equations. However, Korinek cautions that AI in this field is still in development, necessitating manual derivation and rigorous validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI, like ChatGPT, may not fully comprehend economic models, leading to potential erroneous assumptions. Vigilance and active researcher involvement are crucial in mitigating these risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while AI offers promise in economic research, it demands a cautious approach, recognizing both its potential benefits and challenges. Further exploration of the state of AI in economic research, potential pitfalls, and best practices is essential."
