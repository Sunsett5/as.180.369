    "All seven strategies proposed by Korinek for using AI in economic research are applicable to my work. I will focus on \"Mathematical Derivations\" because my research involves developing an advanced endogenous growth model and conducting Monte Carlo simulations. Previous literature presents varied frameworks and assumptions for endogenous growth models which try to capture real market's complexity as closely as possible, and my paper aims to complement them with additional aspect of decision making on innovation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formulating equations that align with new assumptions and avoid contradictions is challenging. They must not only be compatible with existing literature but also computationally efficient, given the expected complexity of model parameters and equations. However, Korinek cautions that AI in this field is still in development, necessitating manual derivation and rigorous validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI, like ChatGPT, may not fully comprehend economic models, leading to potential erroneous assumptions. Vigilance and active researcher involvement are crucial in mitigating these risks. Due to the nature of Large Language Models, it is also important to identify any assumptions that ChatGPT may have used which might not work for my paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while ChatGPT offers promise in economic research, it demands a cautious approach, recognizing both its potential benefits and challenges. Tackling theoretical model building in economics might be one venue in which ChatGPT requires the most amount of cross validation by myself to ensure accuracy."
