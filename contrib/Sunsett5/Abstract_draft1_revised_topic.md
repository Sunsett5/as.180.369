**A Heterogeneous-agents Model of Endogenous Growth with Risk Averse Behavior**

The study extends the scope of existing heterogeneous-agents models in the field of endogenous growth. While the concept of endogenous growth driven by the R&D sector has been extensively studied, the majority of pioneering works, such as Romer (1990), have been grounded in the assumption of homogeneous research products. Building on recent contributions by Dosi et al. (2018), which introduced heterogeneity into R&D firms, this paper introduce overlooked heterogeneity in the form of risk-averse workers, each with distinct preferences for engaging in uncertain innovative work as opposed to employment in the consumer or capital goods sectors. Reflecting the underlying uncertainty of R&D sector experienced by every economic agent, the financial side of R & D is also modeled with heterogeneous risk-averse investors. Through Monte Carlo simulations, this research explores the implications of heterogeneity within these various agents on long-term productivity growth and convergence. By addressing this important research gap, we aim to shed light on the nuanced dynamics that govern economic growth and identify possible sources to divergence observed in cross-country empirical studies.
