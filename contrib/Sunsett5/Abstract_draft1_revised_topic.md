**A Heterogeneous-agents Model of Economic Growth with Risk Averse Behavior**

The study presents an extension to existing heterogenous-agents models of economic growth. Endogenous growth due to technological innovation has been studied extensively, although many hinge on representative market. In this model, we model the financial side of R&D with risk-averse heterogenous investors. We show that this assumption affect the long-run impact of macroeconomic variables through heterogeneous asset holding preference. The calibrated model is then tested against panel of ... countries.
