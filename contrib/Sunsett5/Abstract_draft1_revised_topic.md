**A Heterogeneous-agents Model of Economic Growth with Risk Averse Behavior**

The study presents an extension to existing heterogenous-agents models of endogenous growth. Endogenous growth due to R & D sector has been studied extensively, although many, such as Romer (1990), hinge on homogeneous research products. Recent contribution by Dosi et al. (2018) suggests that R & D firms are modeled as heterogenous. Here, I introduce further heterogeneity in the form of risk-averse workers who have different preference to engage in uncertain innovative work instead of consumer or capital goods industry. In parallel, the financial side of R & D is modeled with heterogeneous risk-averse investors. I then illustrate the effect of heterogenous agents on long-run productivity growth and convergence with Monte Carlo simulations.
